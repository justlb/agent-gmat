# GNC Interface Contract Template

Use this template for `<workspace>/AIGNC_Workflow/05_fsw_requirements/gnc_interface_contract.md`.

Hard rules:

- Fill every mission-relevant `Mission Value`, `Code/Artifact Anchor`, and `Verification Method` cell before asking the user to confirm.
- Do not leave `TBD`, `Unknown`, blank required cells, or unresolved alternatives in the contract. If a required value is unknown, stop and ask the user before issuing the contract for confirmation.
- Use `N/A - <reason>` only for rows that are genuinely not applicable to the mission.
- Keep `User Confirmation` as `Pending` while the contract is awaiting user review.
- Set `Status: Frozen_By_User`, `Confirmed By`, and `Confirmed At` only after explicit user confirmation in the conversation.
- Do not use this file as a long design report. It is an implementation gate and semantic contract.

# GNC Interface Contract

Mission: <MISSION_NAME>
Version: <YYYY-MM-DD or revision id>
Status: Pending_User_Confirmation
Prepared By: Agent
Confirmed By: <TBD until explicit user confirmation>
Confirmed At: <TBD until explicit user confirmation>
Source Documents:
- <path or conversation reference>
Implementation Gate: FSW architecture planning and code authoring are blocked until Status is Frozen_By_User.
